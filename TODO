TODO:
- Cross-browser rounded corner in bubble
- Bad geocodes:
  Merrill Lynch lobby, Broadway & Park Row
  13 & Broadway
  116 & Broadway
- Add date and heard by in info window bubble

  
Done:
- Neighborhoods when really zoomed out
- Flickering when switching between quotes
- window.console.log may not always be available
- window width/height cross browser
- Basic search
- Logo and name
- Rezoom to bounding box of search result (but at least medium level)
- Display last update date/most recent quote
- Distinctive marker for locations with 10+ quotes
- Rendering issues in Safari (add/removeClass not working right)
- Shorter header
- A bit of dragging is ok for triggering info windows
- Filter info window based on search terms
- Word level matches
- Consolidate locations, e.g. "Times Square" and "Times Square station" or "Broadway & Waverly" and "Waverly & Broadway"
- Duplicate quotes for some markers (e.g. Broadway & Waverly)
- Handle clicks in the shadow
- Close box overlap with header (e.g. at 21st and 6th)
- shuffle mode
- Do away with medium zoom level and keep neighborhoods and outlines until 14 (inclusive)
- Minimize overlapping polygon sides between neighborhoods
- 6th avenue locations mapped to Brooklyn
- Replace neighborhoods polygons with faster canvas overlay
- Better unescaping for the locations CSV reader
- Fix geocoding for locations with store names in them
- Make neighborhoods overlay work in MSIE (use canvas wrapper)
- Consider single/better neighborhood border color(s)
- DOM exception when opening info window
- Linkify logo
